# Caddy MIB - Caddy Middleware for IP Banning

## Overview
**Caddy MIB (Middleware IP Ban)** is a custom Caddy HTTP middleware designed to track client IPs generating repetitive errors (such as `404` or `500`) and temporarily ban them after exceeding a specified threshold. This middleware helps mitigate brute force attacks, excessive requests for non-existent resources, or other abusive behavior by blocking IPs that breach the configured error limits.

---

## Features
- **[Track Specific HTTP Error Codes](#configuration)**: Configure which HTTP error codes (e.g., `404`, `500`) to track.
- **[Set Error Thresholds](#configuration)**: Define the maximum number of errors allowed per IP before banning.
- **[Custom Ban Duration](#configuration)**: Specify how long an IP should be banned (e.g., `10m`, `1h`).
- **[Dynamic Ban Duration](#configuration)**: Increase ban duration exponentially with repeated offenses.
- **[Whitelist Trusted IPs](#configuration)**: Exempt specific IPs from banning, even if they trigger errors.
- **[Dynamic Configuration](#configuration)**: Easily configure the middleware using the Caddyfile.
- **[Debug Logging](#debugging)**: Detailed logs to track IP bans, error counts, and request statuses.
- **[Automatic Unbanning](#overview)**: Banned IPs are automatically unbanned after the ban duration expires.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mib.git
cd caddy-mib
```

### 2. Build the Caddy Binary with MIB Module
```bash
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mib=./
```

### 3. Verify the Build
```bash
./caddy version
```
Ensure the `caddy-mib` module is included by checking the version output.

---

## Configuration

### Caddyfile Example
```Caddyfile
:8080 {
    route {
        caddy_mib {
            error_codes 404           # Error codes to track (e.g., 404, 500)
            max_error_count 5         # Number of errors allowed before banning
            ban_duration 10m          # Base duration to ban IPs (e.g., 10m, 1h)
            ban_duration_multiplier 2 # Increase ban duration exponentially (e.g., 2x)
            output stdout             # Log output (stdout or stderr)
            whitelist 192.168.1.1     # Whitelist specific IPs (comma-separated)
        }
        file_server {
            root /var/www/html        # Serve files from this directory
        }
    }
    log {
        output stdout
        format json                  # Log in JSON format
    }
}
```

### Directive Options
- **`error_codes`**: List of space-separated HTTP error codes to track (e.g., `404 500`).
- **`max_error_count`**: Maximum number of errors allowed before banning an IP.
- **`ban_duration`**: Base duration to ban IPs (supports values like `1m`, `5m`, `1h`).
- **`ban_duration_multiplier`**: Multiplier to increase ban duration exponentially with repeated offenses (e.g., `2` for 2x increase).
- **`output`**: Log output stream (`stdout` or `stderr`).
- **`whitelist`**: List of IPs to exempt from banning (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

---

## Usage

### Example Scenario
1. A client repeatedly requests a non-existent resource (`/nonexistent-file`), resulting in `404 Not Found` errors.
2. After 5 such errors, the client's IP is banned for 10 minutes.
3. If the client continues to generate errors, the ban duration increases exponentially (e.g., 20m, 40m, etc.).
4. Whitelisted IPs are never banned, even if they trigger errors.
5. Subsequent requests from the banned IP return `403 Forbidden` until the ban expires.

### Testing
Run the following command to test the middleware:
```bash
for i in {1..7}; do curl -I http://localhost:8080/nonexistent-file; sleep 1; done
```

#### Expected Output:
- The first 5 requests return `404 Not Found`.
- The 6th and 7th requests return `403 Forbidden` (IP banned).

---

## Debugging

### Logs
Check the Caddy logs for detailed information about IP bans and request statuses:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/caddy/access.log
```

#### Example Logs:
```bash
INFO	http.handlers.caddy_mib	IP banned	{"ip": "::1", "error_code": 404, "error_count": 5, "max_error_count": 5, "ban_duration": "10m0s", "ban_expires_at": "2025-01-09T16:21:45.435Z", "path": "/nonexistent-file"}
INFO	http.handlers.caddy_mib	IP is currently banned	{"ip": "::1", "path": "/nonexistent-file", "ban_expires_at": "2025-01-09T16:21:45.435Z"}
INFO	http.handlers.caddy_mib	IP is whitelisted, skipping middleware	{"ip": "192.168.1.1", "path": "/nonexistent-file"}
```

# üåê Combining Caddy Modules for Enhanced Security

Did you know you can combine **caddy-waf**, **caddy-mib**, and **caddy-mlf** to create a robust multi-layered security solution for your web applications? By chaining these modules, you can leverage their unique features to provide comprehensive protection against web attacks, abusive behavior, and suspicious traffic patterns.

## üîó Chain Overview

By chaining these modules, you can set up a flow where each layer contributes to filtering, banning, and analyzing traffic for maximum security:

| Module       | Role in the Chain                                                                                           | Repository Link                                   |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **caddy-waf** | Acts as the first gate, inspecting and filtering malicious requests based on anomaly scores, rate limits, and blacklists. | [GitHub: caddy-waf](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf) |
| **caddy-mib** | Handles IP banning for repeated errors, such as 404 or 500, to prevent brute force or abusive access attempts. | [GitHub: caddy-mib](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mib) |
| **caddy-mlf** | Provides an additional layer of protection by analyzing request attributes and marking/blocking suspicious traffic based on anomaly thresholds. | [GitHub: caddy-mlf](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mlf) |

---

## üîß Example Configuration

Here‚Äôs an example configuration to chain the modules:

### Flow:
1. **caddy-waf**: Listens on `localhost:8080` and forwards requests to **caddy-mib**.
2. **caddy-mib**: Listens on `localhost:8081` and forwards requests to **caddy-mlf**.
3. **caddy-mlf**: Listens on `localhost:8082` and returns a `200 OK` response for legitimate requests or forwards requests to your **origin applications**.
