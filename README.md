# Caddy MIB - Middleware IP Ban for Caddy

## Overview
**Caddy MIB (Middleware IP Ban)** is a powerful and flexible custom Caddy HTTP middleware designed to safeguard your web applications by proactively tracking client IP addresses exhibiting repetitive error patterns (e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`). Upon exceeding a configurable error threshold, Caddy MIB temporarily bans the offending IP, effectively mitigating brute-force attacks, preventing abuse of non-existent resources, and limiting other forms of malicious activity. This middleware is an essential tool for any security-conscious web administrator using Caddy.

## Key Features
*   **Error Code Tracking**: Monitor specific HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500).
*   **Configurable Error Limits**: Set max errors per IP before banning.
*   **Flexible Ban Times**: Use human-readable formats (e.g., 5s, 10m, 1h).
*   **Exponential Ban Increase**: Ban duration grows for repeat offenders.
*   **Trusted IP Whitelisting**: Exclude specific IPs or CIDRs from bans.
*   **Path-Specific Settings**: Tailor limits and bans per URL path.
*   **Custom Ban Messages**: Set custom response bodies and headers.
*   **Adjustable Ban Status Codes**: Choose between 403 or 429 for banned IPs.
*   **Detailed Logging**: Track IP, error code, ban times, and request data.
*   **Automatic Ban Removal**: Bans are automatically lifted upon expiration.

## Requirements
- **Go 1.20 or later** - For building the custom Caddy module.
- **Caddy v2.9.0 or later** - The Caddy web server and its plugin framework.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the Caddy MIB repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mib.git
cd caddy-mib
```

### 2. Build Caddy with the MIB Module
Use `xcaddy` to compile Caddy with the custom MIB module:
```bash
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-mib=./
```

### 3. Verify the Installation
Check the installed Caddy version to confirm the presence of `caddy-mib`:
```bash
./caddy version
```

You should see `caddy-mib` listed among the modules.

## Configuration

### Caddyfile Example
Here's a comprehensive example showcasing a range of options:
```caddyfile
{
    admin off # Disable the admin endpoint for production
    log {
        level debug  # Set log level for detailed debugging
        output stdout  # Output logs to the console
        format console # Use human-readable log format
    }
}

:8080 { # Listen on port 8080
    route {
        caddy_mib {
            error_codes 404 500 401  # Track 404, 500, and 401 errors
            max_error_count 10 # Allow up to 10 global errors
            ban_duration 5s # Base ban duration of 5 seconds
            ban_duration_multiplier 1.5 # Increase ban duration for repeat offenders
            whitelist 127.0.0.1 ::1 192.168.1.0/24 # Whitelist local IPs and network
			log_request_headers  User-Agent X-Custom-Header  # Log specified request headers
            log_level debug  # Debug log level for this middleware
            ban_response_body "You have been temporarily blocked due to excessive errors. Please try again later." # Custom ban response message
            ban_status_code 429 # Use the 429 Too Many Requests status code

             cidr_bans 10.0.0.0/8  # CIDR to ban
			 # Custom response header example
            custom_response_header  "This is a custom message,Another message"


            per_path /login {
                error_codes 404  # Track only 404 errors on /login
                max_error_count 5  # Only allow 5 errors before banning
                ban_duration 10s # Ban duration of 10 seconds
                ban_duration_multiplier 2 # Exponential increase in /login ban duration
            }

            per_path /api {
                error_codes 404 500  # Track 404 and 500 errors on /api
                max_error_count 8  # Allow 8 errors before banning
                ban_duration 15s  # 15-second ban duration
                ban_duration_multiplier 1  # No exponential increase in /api ban duration
            }
        }

        handle {
            respond "Hello world!" 404  # Fallback response for unhandled routes
        }
    }
}
```

### Directive Options

## Usage

### Example Scenario

1.  A client makes multiple requests to a URL that does not exist on your server, generating `404 Not Found` responses.
2.  The client exceeds the global `max_error_count`, resulting in a global ban.
3.  The client's IP receives a `429 Too Many Requests` response with the custom `ban_response_body`.
4.  The client attempts to access the `/login` endpoint, which is configured with specific error limits and ban duration that are different than the global ones.
5. The client is banned after triggering multiple 404, resulting in a separate ban and `429` response.

### Best Practices

*   **Start with a reasonable `max_error_count`**: This should be high enough to avoid banning legitimate users and bots while still protecting against malicious attacks.
*   **Use a moderate `ban_duration`**: Start with a short ban duration and gradually increase it if needed.
*   **Utilize `ban_duration_multiplier` wisely**: Be careful when using exponential multipliers, as they can quickly lead to very long ban times.
*   **Whitelist trusted networks**: It's good practice to whitelist internal networks to prevent self-blocking.
*   **Set proper log levels**: Setting `log_level` to `debug` can help during testing, while `info` or `warn` are more suitable for production use.
*	**Use `cidr_bans`**: Use `cidr_bans` in combination with the `whitelist` for more precise configuration.

### Logs
Monitor the Caddy logs for insightful debugging information. Tail the Caddy log file:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/caddy/access.log
```

Example log messages:
```
2025/01/11 11:42:44.621 INFO http.handlers.caddy_mib IP banned {"client_ip": "::1", "error_code": 404, "ban_expires": "2025/01/11 11:42:49.630"}
2025/01/11 11:42:49.665 INFO http.handlers.caddy_mib cleaned up expired ban {"client_ip": "::1"}
```
These log lines provide valuable information on when IPs are banned, which error codes trigger a ban, and when bans expire.
